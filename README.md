Project for Girls Hoo Hack 2025 at UVA
Made by Maggie Zhang, Grace Chen, Ashley Huo

## Project Details
Our program seeks to replicate a fair chance for everyone to access art. We heard some people felt upset that they were not able to find some clothing they liked despite exchanging their own in already. This web application let's UVA students upload their art like a gallery and other students can view and request to exchange their art for yours. Every student can choose whether or not they want to exchange, ultimately allowing them to feel in control of what happens to their item. We originally wanted it to match students up if they requested each other's art to make the exchange more efficient and clearer.
